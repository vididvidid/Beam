## Why Beam?
The world is full of distractions. Apps, websites, notifications‚Äîeverywhere you turn, something is fighting for your attention. But let‚Äôs imagine a world where your technology is truly designed for you. A world where you choose your focus, and every interaction on your screen is precisely what you need, nothing more, nothing less.

**That‚Äôs Beam.** Beam isn‚Äôt just a tool; it‚Äôs a philosophy. It‚Äôs about **freedom**‚Äîfreedom to focus, freedom to create, and freedom to do what matters most.

## The Foundation of Beam‚Äôs Solution

### **Image-to-Text Conversion**
   - **Approach**: Initially, we considered building a custom model using TensorFlow. Given the diversity of image content, we opted for the **Ollama model**, which we hosted on **Cloudflare** for consistent processing.
   
   - **How it Works**:  
      1. Beam processes each image input, whether from photos or video frames.
      2. Beam extracts relevant text data that‚Äôs seamlessly integrated into your workspace.

### **Blurring the Irrelevant in Videos**

   - **Step-by-Step**:  
      1. Videos are divided into frames.
      2. Unique frames are identified and isolated.
      3. Frames are processed with a simple ‚ÄúYes/No‚Äù filter.
      4. Beam reassembles the video, selectively blurring frames where unnecessary content is detected.

   **Prompt**:

### **Screen Overlay App for Focused Study with Hot Reloading**

   - **How It Works**:  
      1. **User Input**: Enter your focus topic.
      2. **Initial Screenshot**: Beam captures the initial screen state.
      3. **Content Analysis**: Beam evaluates each screen element based on the focus topic.
      4. **Overlay Creation**: Distracting content is softly covered to maintain focus.
      5. **Hot Reloading**: Beam continuously monitors the screen and updates overlays in real time.

   **Initial Screen**:
